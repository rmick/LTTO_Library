This is a simple to use LTTO compatible Infra-red communications library, to work with LTTO/LTX/LTAR (Hasbro/Nerf) laser tag systems

It works with any Arduino Uno or Mega board.

I am a self taught programmer, who has been using Arduino's since early 2015.
I am still learning, but my code is now at the point that I am happy to share it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CIRCUIT REQUIREMENTS

Connect an IR LED between Pin 13 and a 100 ohm resistor to GND.
Part # TSAL6200

Connect a 38kHz IR receiver as below
Part # TSOP4138
    - IR receiver Pin1 (Out) to Arduino Pin 11
    - IR receiver Pin2 (Gnd) to Arduino GND
    - IR receiver Pin3 (Vcc) to Arduino +5v

GETTING STARTED

This library is designed to be very simple for even an Arduino newbie.
You must install the LTTO library as well as the EnableInterrupt library (https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt)

1)  Make sure that you have a good understanding of these examples.
    - Basics / Blink
    - Digital / Button
    - AnalogReadSerial or DigitalReadSerial
    - www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

2)  Start with SendTag or SendLTAG both of which send a tag when the button is pressed.
    Use the Digital/Button example circuit - just replace the normal LED with an IR LED.
    - SendTag is for hosted games (be aware that you must have a tagger with same Team # & Player ID in the game for the shot to be received)
    - SendLTAG is for non hosted games

3)  Medic Station is a simple Respawn station that sends a Respawn signal when the button is pressed.
    Use the Digital/Button example circuit - just replace the normal LED with an IR LED.
    (This works in hosted games where the MedicMode is enabled)
    There is an optional delay setting so that the user has to wait XX seconds after pressing the button
    for the Respawn signal (we use 30 seconds to stop people re-entering the game too quickly)

4)  SendTextMessage sends the text 'HELLO' to any gun in range.
    Use the Digital/Button example circuit - just replace the normal LED with an IR LED.
    It is a good way to start learning how to send IR messages.
    Visit wiki.lazerswarm for details on the protocol

5)  ReceiveTag sends a message with the details of the tag received to the Arduino Serial Monitor.
    Connect the IR receiver as per the circuit above, and set the Serial Monitor speed to 115200 baud.

6)  ReceiveIR sends a complete decode of all IR messages to the Arduino Serial Monitor.
    Connect the IR receiver as per the circuit above, and set the Serial Monitor speed to 115200 baud.

    * 3ms On, 6ms Off, 3ms (preamble) followed by 7 bits spaced apart by 2ms. One is represented by 2ms, zero is 1ms
    * In regular lazertag mode, the player and team bits are zero, but the last two bits signify how powerful the blast is.

Another Bald person saved the day when I started to run out SRAM in my Uno and got the usual random lockups.
I was just about to upgrade to Mega boards when I found this blog on the F macro,
and 10 minutes later had recovered 40% of my SRAM and the project was back on track.


Ken Sherriff - for his ubiqitous IR library.
Although I no longer use it in the project, it taught me most of what I needed to know to create the current code.
I ditched the library for a number of reasons.
  1)  I needed to use different Pins for the IR_RECEIVE and IR_SEND, as the pins in the library were used for the LCD touch screen.
  2)  I really wanted duplex send/receive, whereas in Ken's library sending turns off receive.
      To me this is the MOST important aspect of a LaserTag system, it must be able to be shot whilst it is shooting.

Nick Gammon - In the last few months almost everytime I visited the Arduino.cc forum to ask a question, Nick had already posted an answer.
              After a while I started to read his blogs and other posts, and learn't a massive amount about the low level workings of the Arduino.
